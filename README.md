# Graduation Project: Health Care Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

2. Clone this project's repo onto your machine or download as zip.
3. Go to your project root directory, open terminal and run `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
4. Make sure your backend server is up and running, whether on a remote server or localhost. Update [_baseURL_](./src/endpoints.js) link if needed.
5. Run `npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
